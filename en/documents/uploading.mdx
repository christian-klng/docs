Revisory automatically processes your documents to extract text for AI analysis.

## Uploading

1. Click **Documents** in the sidebar
2. Navigate to the desired folder (optional)
3. Drag files into the upload area or click **Select File**
4. You can upload multiple files at once

## Processing Status

After upload, each document goes through automatic processing:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Pending** | Document waiting for processing |
| **Processing** | Text is being extracted |
| **Done** | Document is ready for analyses |
| **Failed** | Extraction not possible |

<Info>
Processing takes a few seconds to a minute, depending on file size and format.
</Info>

## Adding URLs

Besides files, you can also analyze web pages:

1. Click **Add URL**
2. Enter the full URL (including `https://`)
3. Revisory automatically loads and extracts the page content

## Versioning

If you upload a file with the same name again, Revisory automatically creates a new version. The filename receives a suffix (e.g., `report.pdf` → `report_v2.pdf`).

## Limits

- Maximum file size: 10 MB per file
- Supported formats: See [Supported Formats](/en/documents/supported-formats)

<Warning>
Documents with "Failed" status cannot be used for analyses. Check the format and upload the file again.
</Warning>
