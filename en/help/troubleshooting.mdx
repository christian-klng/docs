## Login & account

### I'm not receiving the confirmation email

1. Check your spam folder
2. Make sure the email address is spelled correctly
3. Wait a few minutes – sometimes there are delays
4. Click "Resend" on the confirmation page

### My password reset isn't working

- The reset link is only valid for 1 hour
- Request a new link
- Use the most recent link if you requested multiple

### OAuth login fails

- Make sure cookies are enabled
- Try a private browser window
- Check if you're signed in to Google/GitHub

## Documents

### My document is stuck on "Processing"

Processing can take several minutes depending on file size. If the status doesn't change after 5 minutes:

1. Delete the document
2. Upload it again
3. Make sure the format is supported

### Text extraction is incomplete

For scanned PDFs or documents with complex layouts, extraction may be affected:

- Use text-based PDFs when possible
- For scanned documents: Use higher scan quality
- Alternative: Enter text manually in the editor

### Upload keeps failing

- Check your internet connection
- Maximum file size is 10 MB
- Try a different browser

## Analyses

### The analysis won't start

- Make sure at least one document is assigned
- All assigned documents must have "Ready" status
- Check if you have enough credits

### The results seem wrong to me

Result quality depends heavily on evaluation steps:

- Formulate criteria more precisely and concretely
- Define clear scoring schemes
- Use examples in criteria descriptions

### The analysis takes very long

Duration depends on the number of documents and steps. For extensive analyses:

- Split the analysis into smaller units
- Analyze fewer documents at once

## General

### The page won't load

1. Refresh the page (Ctrl/Cmd + R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Try a different browser
4. Check [status.revisory.ai](https://status.revisory.ai) for known issues
