In this guide, you'll upload a document, create an evaluation category, and run your first AI-powered analysis.

## Step 1: Upload a Document

1. Click **Documents** in the sidebar
2. Drag a file into the upload area or click **Select File**
3. Wait until the status changes from "Processing" to "Done"

<Tip>
Supported formats: PDF, DOCX, XLSX, TXT, MD, and URLs. Revisory automatically extracts the text for AI analysis.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Create a Category

A category defines what documents should be evaluated against.

1. Click **Categories** in the sidebar
2. Click **New Category**
3. Enter a name, e.g., "Project Proposals"
4. Save the category

## Step 3: Add Evaluation Steps

Evaluation steps are the criteria the AI uses for scoring.

1. Open the created category
2. Click **Add Step**
3. Enter a title, e.g., "Objectives clearly stated"
4. Define the criteria: What must be fulfilled for 0, 1, 2, or 3 points?
5. Repeat for additional criteria, or use **Import from Document** to automatically extract criteria from an existing document

<Info>
You can also use a template: Click **Create from Template** instead of **New Category** to start with predefined evaluation steps.
</Info>

## Step 4: Create an Analysis

1. In the category, click **New Analysis**
2. Give the analysis a name
3. Select the documents to be analyzed
4. Click **Create**

## Step 5: Start the Analysis

1. Open the created analysis
2. Verify that all desired documents and steps are assigned
3. Click **Start Analysis**
4. Wait while the AI checks all documents against all criteria (takes 10–60 seconds depending on scope)

## Step 6: View Results

After completion, you'll see for each document:

- **Total Score:** Sum of all criteria
- **Individual Ratings:** Points per evaluation step
- **Strengths:** What the document does well
- **Weaknesses:** Where there's room for improvement
- **Feedback:** Specific suggestions from the AI
