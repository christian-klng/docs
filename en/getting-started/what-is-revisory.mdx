Revisory helps organizations evaluate documents against defined criteria—faster and more consistently than manual reviews.

## The Problem

Many organizations struggle with the same challenges:

- **Inconsistent evaluations:** Different people rate documents differently
- **Time consumption:** Thorough reviews take a long time
- **Lack of structure:** Evaluation criteria only exist in reviewers' heads
- **No organizational learning:** Insights from reviews disappear in emails

## The Solution

Revisory solves these problems through three core concepts:

### Categories

A category is a topic area for which you want to analyze documents. Examples: "Project Proposals", "Contract Templates", "Compliance Reports".

Each category contains evaluation steps that define what to look for.

### Evaluation Steps

Evaluation steps are the specific criteria against which documents are assessed. Each step contains:

- A clear description of the criterion
- A scoring scheme (e.g., 0–3 points)
- Definitions of what must be fulfilled for each score

### Analyses

An analysis applies a category's evaluation steps to selected documents. The AI checks each document against each criterion and delivers:

- Scores per criterion
- Identified strengths and weaknesses
- Concrete feedback for improvement

## Typical Workflow

```
1. Upload document
       ↓
2. Create category with evaluation steps (or use a template)
       ↓
3. Create analysis and assign documents
       ↓
4. Start analysis → AI evaluates automatically
       ↓
5. Review results and improve documents
```

## Who is Revisory For?

Revisory is suitable for anyone who regularly evaluates documents against certain standards:

- **Quality Management:** Review process documentation
- **Compliance:** Check reports for completeness
- **Education:** Evaluate theses or reports
- **Project Management:** Assess proposals and concepts
