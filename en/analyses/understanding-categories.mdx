A category is a container for related evaluation criteria. You create a category for each document type you want to analyze regularly.

## Concept

Think of a category as a checklist: "What do I look for when reviewing this type of document?"

Examples of categories:

- **Project proposals:** Is the goal clear? Are resources planned? Is there a timeline?
- **Compliance reports:** Are all mandatory details included? Is the language precise?
- **Contract templates:** Are rights and obligations balanced? Are important clauses missing?

## Creating a category

1. Click **Categories** in the sidebar
2. Click **New Category**
3. Enter a descriptive name
4. Optional: Choose whether to display scores
5. Click **Create**

## Editing a category

Click on a category to open it. Here you can:

- Change the name
- Toggle score display on/off
- Add, edit, or sort evaluation steps

## Archiving a category

You can archive categories you no longer need:

1. Open the category
2. Click the menu (three dots)
3. Select **Archive**

Archived categories no longer appear in the main list, but existing analyses are preserved.

<Info>
You can view and reactivate archived categories anytime using the "Show archived" filter.
