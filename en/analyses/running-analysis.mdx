An analysis applies the evaluation steps of a category to selected documents.

## Creating an analysis

2. Click **New Analysis**
3. Enter a name (e.g., "Q4 Project Proposals" or "December Applications")
4. Select the documents to analyze
5. Click **Create**

<Tip>

</Tip>

## Assigning documents

After creation, you can add or remove documents at any time:

1. Open the analysis
2. Click **Edit Documents**
3. Select additional documents or remove existing ones
4. Save the changes

## Starting the analysis

1. In the analysis view, verify that all documents and steps are correct
2. Click **Start Analysis**
3. The AI begins the evaluation

During the analysis you'll see:

- A progress bar
- The currently processed step
- The estimated remaining time

## How AI evaluation works

The AI evaluates each document against each evaluation step:

```
Document 1 × Step 1 → Result
Document 1 × Step 2 → Result
...
Document 2 × Step 1 → Result
...
```

Depending on the number of documents and steps, this takes 10 seconds to several minutes.

## Re-running an analysis

You can run an analysis multiple times – for example, after revising documents:

1. Open the existing analysis
2. Click **Run Again**
3. A new run is started

All runs are saved with timestamps, allowing you to compare progress.

## Credits

Each analysis consumes credits based on:

- Number of documents
- Number of evaluation steps
- Length of documents

The estimated credit usage is displayed before starting.
