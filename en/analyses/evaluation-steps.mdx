Evaluation steps are the individual criteria within a category. The more precisely you formulate them, the more meaningful the AI evaluations become.

## Structure of an evaluation step

Each step consists of:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Title** | Short name of the criterion |
| **Description** | Detailed explanation of what is being evaluated |
| **Scoring scheme** | Definition of what must be met for 0, 1, 2, 3 (etc.) points |
| **Maximum score** | Highest possible score for this criterion |

## Creating a step

1. Open a category
2. Click **Add Step**
3. Enter title and description
4. Define the scoring scheme
5. Click **Save**

## Writing good criteria

<Tip>
The more specific the criterion, the better the evaluation.
</Tip>

**Poor:** "The text is well written"

**Better:** "The objective is clearly stated in the first paragraph"

**Optimal with scoring scheme:**
- 0 points: No objective recognizable
- 1 point: Objective vaguely suggested
- 2 points: Objective mentioned but not in the first paragraph
- 3 points: Objective clearly stated in the first paragraph

## Sorting steps

The order of steps determines the order in results:

1. Open the category
2. Drag and drop steps to the desired position
3. The new order is saved automatically

## Importing steps from a document

Already have a document with evaluation criteria? Let the AI extract them:

1. Click **Import from Document** in the category
2. Select the document containing the criteria
3. The AI suggests evaluation steps
4. Review and adjust the suggestions
5. Confirm the import

## Versioning

Evaluation steps are versioned. When you modify a step:

- Existing analyses retain the old version
- New analyses use the updated version
- You can see in analyses whether newer versions are available
